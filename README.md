### Examples

All examples are in the `examples` folder.

* [**sale**](https://github.com/ElemeFE/page-skeleton-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/sale)

### Installation

Use `npm` to install this plugin, and you also need to install [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin).

> npm install --save-dev page-skeleton-webpack-plugin
> 
> npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin

### Basic Use

**Step 1：configration**

After installing the plug-in according to the above tutorial, you need to configure the plugin so that the plugin can run normally. The plugin will perform different operations depending on the environment of the node. When `NODE_ENV === 'development'`, the plug-in can perform operations for generating and writing skeleton pages.

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin')
const { SkeletonPlugin } = require('page-skeleton-webpack-plugin')
const path = require('path')
const webpackConfig = {
  entry: 'index.js',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/dist',
    filename: 'index.bundle.js'
  },
  plugin: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
       // Your HtmlWebpackPlugin config
    }),
    new SkeletonPlugin({
        pathname: path.resolve(__dirname, `${customPath}`), // the path to store shell file
        staticDir: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'), // the same as the `output.path`
        routes: ['/', '/search'], // Which routes you want to generate skeleton screen
    })
  ]
}
```

:notebook_with_decorative_cover:Since the plugin selects different operations based on the `process.env.NODE_ENV` environment variable, so you need to configurate environment variables in the `scripts` option in the `package.json` file as follows:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development node server.js",
  "build": "rm -rf dist && cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --progress --hide-modules"
}
```

That is, setting `NODE_ENV` to `development` in the development environment and `NODE_ENV` to `production` in the production environment.

#### Step 2：Modify template `index.html` of html-webpack-plugin

Add comment `<!-- shell -->` in the root element of you application.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <!-- shell -->
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Step 3：Operations and write shell

In the development page, use CtrlOrCmd + enter to call out the plugin interactive interface, or enter the `toggleBar` callout interface in the browser's JavaScript console.

![](./docs/step1.jpg)

Click the button in the interactive interface to preview the skeleton page. This process may take about 20s. After the plugin is ready for the skeleton page, it will automatically open the preview page through the browser, as shown below.

![](./docs/step2.jpg)

Scan the QR code in the preview page to preview the skeleton page on the mobile phone. You can directly edit the source code on the preview page. Write the skeleton page into the shell.html file by clicking the Write button in the upper right corner.

Re-package the application with webpack. When the page is restarted, you can see the application's skeleton structure before getting the data.
